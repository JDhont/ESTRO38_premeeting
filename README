# THE CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY CLINICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS. 
# BUT RATHER TO HAVE A WORKING EXAMPLE RELATED TO RT TO START WITH MACHINE LEARNING.

# The presentation related to this example can be found here (https://github.com/JDhont/ESTRO38_premeeting) as well.

# The .ipynb file can be opened and run as a jupyter notebook.
# In order for the code to work, you need to have python, Jupyter notebook and sklearn installed (including numpy, scipy, pandas and matplotlib packages). 
# Go to the python.org, jupyter.org and sklearn.org download/installation pages and follow the instructions depending on your operating system.
# Note that MAC often comes with pre-installed python.

# The artificial (!!) dataset used in this example is also located in this repository. 

# Friendly question, remarks or recommendations are always welcome: jdhont @ etrovub . be (remove spaces)

# Have fun!
